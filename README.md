# Findr

* Queries NYC Open Data on Bootstrap-built site to find free WiFi locations in NYC closest to given address
* Caches Google Geocoding and Distance Matrix API results in database

Give it a test run with a valid NYC address (short form address works just fine), and then try running the test again.
